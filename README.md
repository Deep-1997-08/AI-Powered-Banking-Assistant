# AI-Powered Banking Assistant

This project aims to develop an AI-powered banking assistant that leverages various advanced AI and machine learning techniques to enhance customer interaction and streamline banking operations.

## Project Description

The AI-Powered Banking Assistant integrates multiple state-of-the-art technologies to deliver a seamless and intelligent banking experience. This project involves:

- **Natural Language Understanding and Response Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for interpreting and responding to customer queries, providing accurate and context-aware answers.
- **Speech-to-Text Functionality**: Implements Whisper for converting spoken language into text, ensuring accessibility and convenience for users.
- **Agentic Workflows**: Leverages Langchain and Haystack frameworks to manage and automate complex banking processes, reducing response times and improving efficiency.
- **Semantic Search**: Uses a vector database (Pinecone) for efficient and precise information retrieval, allowing quick access to relevant banking documents and customer records.
- **Embedding Creation**: Employs MPNet and Ada models to create high-quality embeddings, enhancing the accuracy of query matching and document retrieval tasks.
- **Advanced Techniques**: Incorporates techniques such as HyDE, MMR, and LLM reranking to optimize semantic search, significantly improving query resolution accuracy.
